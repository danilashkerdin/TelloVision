# TelloVision
https://github.com/danilashkerdin/TelloVision/blob/master/resources/Tello.png
The FaceTracker class is the main class of this repo. This is the tello-drone controller that finds your face on the received frame and controlls tello so that your face remains in the center.
I used the FaceVector class as auxiliary.
I tried to write code as simple as possible, sory for the mistakes and omisions. I will be happy to read healthy criticism here: danila.shkerdin.01@mail.ru
